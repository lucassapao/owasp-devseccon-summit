#### How I got involved in OWASP

In 2008, OWASP was organizing the EU Summit in Portugal and issued a Call for Training Providers, seeking trainings to be delivered at the Summit. I had recently finished preparing a "Secure Programming in Java" training in Portuguese and was working with some friends to organize training sessions in Brazil.

At this time, Eduardo Neves, which was helping with the Summit's Call for Trainings, gave me the idea to send a proposal based on the Portuguese materials I had. I accepted, translated some materials to English and submitted. The proposal was accepted and I got authorization from my employer to go to the Summit. In the end, all tranings scheduled for the Summit were turned into 2-hour talks.

During the time between my proposal being accepted and the Summit, I started helping the Summit organizers in small tasks, such as translations and trying to spread the word about OWASP and the Summit. At the Summit, I met several OWASP leaders, specially Dinis Cruz and Paulo Coimbra. I also met several Brazilians and we agreed that we needed an OWASP Conference in Brazil. After returning home, we started talking about it in our mailing list and managed to make it happen in 2009. I was able to convince my bosses to host the first OWASP AppSec in Brasil and got full support. This way, I became the OWASP AppSec Brasil 2009 General Chair.

After the 2009 Conference, we started planning the next one. Again, I became the conference General Chair. After two years of intense work to make the conferences happen, I started dedicating my time to other OWASP projects, but had to let it aside because of my job.
  
Although I gave up all my "titles" at OWASP (as chapter or project leader or committee member), I still want to be involved as a contributor to projects and chapters and will continue as a paid member.
